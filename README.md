# Node E-commerce API
E-Commerce API with Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose , JWT, CryptoJS and Stripe Checkout

Features CRUD functionality for different roles. Users can register, login, create a cart and place an order. Admins can delete / add products, and many more. In this project, Models are created via Mongoose Schemas.
> Due to different version I believe Mongoose syntax for schemas has changed a bit which results in minor bugs to fixed .

## Good to have(s) / Flaws

Please note that this API is not 100% complete. This is my first REST API so there might be little flaws in its design, but I do plan to work on them.
Some of these problems or good to have features would be;

1. Connect to Front-end(React).
2. Admin Dashboard to perform CRUD operations.
3. Fixing small bugs where the admin role cannot GET monthly income.
4. Connecting the STRIPE API to the front end with a checkout screen.

These are the flaws / improvements that I plan to fix/implement in the future.
